# **What I took away from this Repo Exercise:**

1. I got a better understanding of the importance of a read me file and how I can use it to explain the pusrpose of a project.
2. I learned how to create a ***requirements.txt*** file that stores the packages and versions of each that I used in the project.
3. As I have never seen a requirements text file before, it opened my eyes to the fact that I could tell collaborators or project viewers which packages I used and are required to run the script(*s*).
4. The ***.gitignore*** was also a new sight to me, and now I know that it is used to ignore the files and directories which are unnecessary to the project.
5. I now better understand the importance of an entry point in my python script.
6. ***The shebang!*** I was oblivious to the fact that other operating systems exist and might need to run my project. I now know that the shebang tells a system how to execute the script.
7. Overall I learned that python is more powerful than i thought and this Web scraper project can attest to that. The example I followed comes from : [Link here](https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/).
